# **Google Play web-scraper**

My first scraper using selenium. Scraping information and reviews of apps on Google Play market. 
Reviews are saving to csv file for further exploration.

## Using: 

To use scraper, change app’s details page url. Scraper will print basic information about app and then reviews will save in a csv file. 
I also use a ‘tqdm’ package to have a progress bar and estimated scraping time. 
Some lines of code are not needed but it was a learning for me and I wanted to try a lot of selenium's functionalities.
